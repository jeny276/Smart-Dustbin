# Smart-Dustbin
Smart dustbin is one of those innovative ideas. The smart dustbin uses an Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to detect objects in front. It then sends the signals to Arduino Uno. The Arduino understands the signal and sends a signal to the Servomotor which opens the flap on top of the dustbin.
